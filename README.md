# TriviaQuest

A trivia game written in the Unity engine. 

Software you need:
-Unity Hub
-Unity (I used 2018 but I'd imagine 2019 and 2020 would work fine as well)
-Visual Studio (You should have the option to install this when you install Unity)

From Unity Hub:
  1) Install Unity (at least 2018)
  2) Create a new 2D project
  
In Unity:
  3) Import the Assets and Scripts from this commit
  4) Open the "SceneLoader" script to make changes to the game (add points, display score etc)
  


So far, the game lacks full functionality in that you can only press click through it to the end and play again if you want.

I'm still new to C# and Unity, so I couldn't figure out how to display the player's score at the end. I think it'd be cool to add those features
and a few others like game show music, sound effects for selecting the right or wrong answer, and more questions of various topics to extend the game.
